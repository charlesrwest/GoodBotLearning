As far as I can tell, blobs in Caffe2 really are just big arrays in native format.  Given that inputs/outputs are fixed sized with a feed forward network (such as traditional fully connected networks or convolutional networks), it should be possible to just read/write blocks of memory directly (memcpy style) and feed those directly to caffe2 (using parallel processing with ram buffers at a later date).

Modules to implement:
Cast Operator <- done
Scale Operator <- done
Conv operator <- done
Max pool operator <- done
Softmax <- done?
Accuracy?

Might want to make add op/add arg convience functions
